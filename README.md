Restaurant Dataset Analysis
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a restaurant dataset using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib. The analysis focuses on understanding the distribution of restaurants across different cities, calculating average ratings per city, examining the distribution and percentage breakdown of price ranges, and analyzing the availability of online delivery services. It also includes a comparison of average ratings between restaurants that offer online delivery and those that do not. The project features visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and stacked bar graphs to support the analysis and highlight key trends in pricing, customer ratings, and service features.
